Abuot me:
I'm learning for the sake of my future self. Is it hard? Absolutely! Have I missed all the deadlines again? Yes — this is my third restart from scratch. Will I keep trying? Definitely!
I currently work in the IT field, switching between HelpDesk and Monitoring departments. Watching developers at work, I realize — that’s exactly what I want to do too.

Skills:
I want to learn Dart someday — my goal is to work with Flutter.
I'm just starting to use GitHub.
Visual Studio Code is my favorite development tool!
I'm also planning to learn Swift in the future — it looks really exciting.

//code
var drawHearts = function (howManyTimes) {
for (var i = 0; i < howManyTimes; i++) {
console.log(i + "<3>");
}
};
drawHearts(10);

Unfortunately, I don’t have any experience yet and haven’t had the chance to work on personal coding projects.
However, I hope to build a strong portfolio in the future.

Education (including courses and trainings):
Gubkin University of Oil and Gas in Tashkent
Courses in Windows Server
Courses in Linux
Originally, I was on track to become a DevOps specialist.
